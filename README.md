# Insider Threat Detection System

## Overview
This project aims to develop an **Insider Threat Detection System** that monitors user activities within an organization to identify potential insider threats using behavioral analytics. The system leverages machine learning techniques to detect unusual patterns in user behavior, such as large file transfers and access to restricted areas.

## Features
- **User Activity Monitoring**: Tracks and logs user activities in real-time.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Uses machine learning to identify deviations from normal behavior.
- **Dashboard**: A Flask-based web interface to visualize alerts and trends.
- **Log Management**: Stores user activity logs in ElasticSearch for efficient querying and analysis.
- **Explainable Alerts**: Provides explanations for flagged activities.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language for data processing and backend development.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the dashboard and API.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library for implementing machine learning models.
- **ElasticSearch**: Search engine for storing and querying user activity logs.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation and analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- ElasticSearch (installed and running)

## Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insider-threat-detection.git
   cd insider-threat-detection
2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    Copy code
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install required packages**:
    ```bash
    Copy code
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    Set up ElasticSearch:


4. **Download and install ElasticSearch from the official website.**

5. **Start ElasticSearch**:
    ```bash
    Copy code
    ./bin/elasticsearch  # On Windows, use elasticsearch.bat
6. Install request libraries if need be
    ```bash
    pip install requests
Load sample data:

Ensure you have sample logs in data/sample_logs.json.
Run the data loading script:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/load_data.py
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
python run.py
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:5000 to access the application.
Usage
The system will continuously monitor user activities, flagging suspicious behavior based on predefined criteria.
Access the dashboard at http://localhost:5000 to view alerts and insights.
Future Enhancements
Implement advanced machine learning models for improved anomaly detection.
Integrate user feedback mechanisms to refine model accuracy.
Introduce role-based access control for enhanced security in the dashboard.
Support for real-time alert notifications (e.g., via email or SMS).
